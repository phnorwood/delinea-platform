# Delinea Guides

Simple, minimal, and easy-to-follow guides for getting started with Delinea solutions.

## About

Delinea's platform is powerful — but getting up and running shouldn't require sifting through dense documentation. These guides cut through the noise and give IT administrators a clear, step-by-step path from zero to functional deployment. No fluff, no detours — just what you need to know, in the order you need to know it.

Each guide is designed to be followed start to finish in a single session, with prerequisites listed upfront and every action made explicit.
