# UC-11: Comprehensive Audit Trail for Compliance Reporting

**Objective:** Generate reports showing who accessed which cloud account (AWS, GCP, Snowflake), when, from where, and what they did via session recording. Demonstrate the ability to play back recorded console sessions for compliance and audit purposes.

**Prerequisites:**
- Delinea Platform tenant configured with admin access
- Cloud credentials stored from UC-1, UC-3, and UC-4
- Session recording enabled globally
- Several recorded sessions available from previous use case testing
- PRA sessions completed for AWS, GCP, or Snowflake consoles

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

   - Performing common administrative tasks
   - Complete session (not interrupted)
3. Note session details for reference

### 10.2: Present Session to Auditor

Walk through demonstration:

1. **Show Session Metadata:**
   - "This session shows John Doe accessing AWS production console"
   - "Access occurred on February 1, 2026 at 9:15 AM"
   - "Session lasted 28 minutes"
   - "Access was from corporate IP: 192.168.1.45"

2. **Play Recording:**
   - Click Play button
   - "Here you can see the login process"
   - "Password is never visible to us or the user"
   - "User navigated to S3 service"
   - "Viewed bucket contents for 'app-logs-prod'"
   - "Did not download or delete any data"
   - "Signed out cleanly at 9:43 AM"

3. **Show Search Capability:**
   - "We can search for specific actions"
   - Search for "bucket"
   - "Instantly jumps to bucket access in recording"

4. **Demonstrate Audit Trail:**
   - "Every action is timestamped and linked to user identity"
   - "Recording cannot be altered or deleted by users"
   - "Retained for 90 days per compliance policy"

### 10.3: Answer Common Auditor Questions

**Q: Can users delete recordings?**
A: No, only Platform administrators can manage recordings, and deletion is logged.

**Q: Can recordings be altered?**
A: No, recordings are write-once and cryptographically verified.

**Q: How do you prove identity?**
A: Multi-factor authentication required before access, and all actions linked to authenticated user account.

**Q: Can you show me a specific user's activity?**
A: Yes (demonstrate user filter and show all their sessions).

**Q: What if someone uses shared credentials?**
A: Not possible - all credentials checked out to specific users, exclusive access via check-out, session recording links action to individual.
