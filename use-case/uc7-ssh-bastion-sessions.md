# UC-7: Secure SSH Session to Cloud Bastion Hosts

**Objective:** Onboard SSH key pairs used to access critical bastion/jump hosts in AWS or GCP. Users check out the SSH key from the Platform, and the Platform brokers the SSH session through PRA, recording all commands executed with keystroke logging.

**Prerequisites:**
- Delinea Platform tenant configured with admin access
- Platform Engine with PRA workload installed and active
- AWS or GCP bastion host accessible from Platform Engine
- SSH key pair for bastion host access
- Session recording enabled globally

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes

---

## Step 1: Create Folder Structure for SSH Keys

1. Log in to Delinea Platform: `https://[your-tenant].delinea.app`
2. Navigate to **Secret Server → All Secrets**
3. Click **New Folder**
4. Create folder structure:
   ```
   SSH Keys
   ├── AWS Bastion Keys
   └── GCP Bastion Keys
   ```
   - Folder name: `SSH Keys`
   - Parent folder: Root level
   - Click **Create**
5. Create subfolders:
   - `AWS Bastion Keys` under `SSH Keys`
   - `GCP Bastion Keys` under `SSH Keys`

---

## Step 2: Generate or Obtain SSH Key Pair

### 2.1: Generate New SSH Key Pair (If Needed)

On your local machine or secure workstation:

```bash
# Generate new SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f bastion_key -C "platform-managed-key"

# This creates:
# - bastion_key (private key)
# - bastion_key.pub (public key)

# Set secure permissions
chmod 600 bastion_key
chmod 644 bastion_key.pub
```

### 2.2: Add Public Key to Bastion Host

**For AWS EC2 Bastion:**

1. Log in to AWS Console
2. Navigate to **EC2 → Instances**
3. Select your bastion host
4. Connect to instance (using existing access method)
5. Add public key to authorized_keys:

```bash
# On bastion host
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA... platform-managed-key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**For GCP Compute Engine Bastion:**

1. Log in to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to **Compute Engine → VM Instances**
3. Click on your bastion instance
4. Click **Edit**
5. Under **SSH Keys**, click **Add Item**
6. Paste your public key
7. Click **Save**

Or via gcloud CLI:
```bash
gcloud compute instances add-metadata [INSTANCE-NAME] \
  --metadata ssh-keys="[USERNAME]:$(cat bastion_key.pub)"
```

---

## Step 3: Store SSH Key Pair in Platform

### 3.1: Create SSH Key Secret

1. Navigate to **Secret Server → All Secrets**
2. Browse to folder: `/SSH Keys/AWS Bastion Keys` (or GCP)

5. Configure:
   - **Folder:** `/SSH Keys/AWS Bastion Keys`
   - **Secret Name:** `AWS Bastion - [Bastion-Name] - [Environment]`
   - **Host:** Bastion host IP or DNS (e.g., `bastion.example.com` or `54.123.45.67`)
   - **Username:** SSH username (e.g., `ec2-user`, `ubuntu`, or your username)
   - **Private Key:** Click **Upload File** and select `bastion_key`
     - Or paste private key content directly
   - **Passphrase:** Enter if key is encrypted (leave blank if not)
   - **Port:** `22` (default SSH port)
   - **Notes:** "Production bastion host for VPC access"
6. Click **Create Secret**
