# UC-5: Brokered Web Session to Cloud Consoles

**Objective:** Instead of giving an engineer direct credentials to an AWS Admin IAM User, they request access through the Delinea Platform. The Platform launches a browser session via Privileged Remote Access (PRA) to the AWS Management Console without the user ever seeing the password. The entire session is recorded for playback.

**Prerequisites:**
- Delinea Platform tenant configured with admin access
- Platform Engine with PRA workload installed and active
- AWS IAM admin account credentials stored in Platform (from UC-1 or UC-2)
- At least one non-admin user to test access request workflow
- Session recording enabled globally

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

2. Navigate to **Settings → Engine Management**
3. Click on your site
4. Click **Engines** tab
5. Verify your Platform Engine shows:
   - **Status:** Active
   - **Workloads:** PRA (Privileged Remote Access) listed
6. If PRA workload is not active:
   - Click **Edit Engine**
   - Enable **☑ Privileged Remote Access**
   - Click **Save**

### 1.2: Verify Session Recording is Enabled

1. Navigate to **Settings → Administration**
