# UC-6: Time-Limited Access for Snowflake Privileged Roles

**Objective:** Provide time-bound access to Snowflake SYSADMIN credentials through the Delinea Platform with approval workflows and automatic access expiration. While the Platform does not support automated JIT role elevation for Snowflake, this workflow provides time-limited credential checkout with full audit trails as an alternative approach.

**Prerequisites:**
- Delinea Platform tenant configured with admin access
- Snowflake SYSADMIN credentials stored in Platform (from UC-4)
- At least two users: one requester and one approver
- Platform Engine with PRA workload active

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Step 1: Understand the Limitation

### 1.1: Platform Capabilities vs. Requirements

**What the Platform Provides:**
- ✅ Time-limited credential checkout
- ✅ Approval workflows for access
- ✅ Automatic credential check-in after time expires
- ✅ Session recording of Snowflake console activity
- ✅ Complete audit trail of access

**What the Platform Does NOT Provide:**
- ❌ Automatic granting of SYSADMIN role in Snowflake
- ❌ Automatic revocation of SYSADMIN role after time window
- ❌ Direct integration with Snowflake RBAC system

**Workaround Approach:**
Users check out SYSADMIN credentials for a time-limited window, use them to perform elevated tasks, then credentials automatically check back in. The user must manually switch roles within Snowflake.

## Step 6: Access SYSADMIN Credentials and Perform Privileged Task

### 6.1: Check Out Credentials

1. As the data analyst, refresh the secret page
2. You should now see **Check Out** button (or auto-checked out)
3. If not automatic, click **Check Out**
4. Verify:
   - Secret shows "Checked Out by You"
   - Checkout timer is visible (e.g., "1:59:45 remaining")

3. Credentials auto-fill (or manually sign in)
4. Log in to Snowflake web UI
5. Verify you are logged in as SYSADMIN user

### 6.3: Perform Privileged Task in Snowflake

1. Once in Snowflake console, verify current role:
   ```sql
   SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
   -- Should show: SYSADMIN
   ```

2. Create the warehouse as specified in request:
   ```sql
   CREATE WAREHOUSE REPORTING_WH 
   WITH 
     WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
     AUTO_SUSPEND = 300
     AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
     INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;
   ```

3. Verify warehouse creation:
   ```sql
   SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'REPORTING_WH';
   ```

4. Grant appropriate permissions:
   ```sql
   GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE REPORTING_WH TO ROLE ANALYST;
   ```

5. Document actions in Snowflake:
   ```sql
   -- Add comment for audit
   ALTER WAREHOUSE REPORTING_WH 
     SET COMMENT = 'Created for Q1 reporting - [Your Name] - [Date]';
   ```

### 6.4: Complete and Sign Out

### 7.3: Automatic Check-In

1. If you do **not** manually check in:
2. After 2 hours (or configured duration):
   - Secret automatically checks in
   - Access to credentials is revoked
   - Any open PRA sessions may terminate
3. Verify by refreshing secret page:
   - Shows "Not checked out"
   - "Check Out" button reappears (but requires new approval)

   - Approved by [manager] at [timestamp]
   - Secret checked out at [timestamp]
   - Secret checked in at [timestamp] (or auto check-in)
   - Duration: [actual time used]
4. Verify each action is timestamped

### 8.2: Review Session Recording

1. Navigate to **Insights → Session Review**
2. Find the Snowflake session:
   - Filter by **Secret:** Snowflake SYSADMIN
   - Filter by **User:** Data analyst name
   - Filter by **Date:** Today
3. Click on the session
4. Verify session details:
   - **User:** Data analyst username
   - **Duration:** Time spent in Snowflake
   - **Actions:** SQL commands executed (if keystroke logging enabled)
5. Click **Play** to review recording
6. Verify recording shows:

     user_name,
     role_name,
     start_time,
     end_time,
     execution_status
   FROM 
     SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
   WHERE 
     user_name = '[SYSADMIN-USERNAME]'
     AND start_time >= DATEADD(hour, -3, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
   ORDER BY 
     start_time DESC;
   ```

3. Verify queries executed during the 2-hour window:
   - CREATE WAREHOUSE REPORTING_WH
   - GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE

## Step 10: Document Time-Limited Access Procedures

### 10.1: Create User Guide

Document the following for data analysts:

**Requesting SYSADMIN Access:**
1. Navigate to Snowflake SYSADMIN secret in Platform
2. Click "Request Access"
3. Provide detailed justification (minimum 50 characters):
   - What task needs SYSADMIN privileges
   - What objects will be created/modified
   - Expected duration
4. Select duration: 2-4 hours maximum
5. Submit request
6. Wait for manager approval (typically within 1 hour)
7. Once approved, credentials automatically check out
8. Access expires after approved duration

**Using SYSADMIN Access:**
1. Click "Open with Remote Access" in Platform
2. Log in to Snowflake (credentials auto-fill)
3. Verify current role is SYSADMIN
4. Perform only the approved tasks
5. Document all actions with comments in Snowflake
6. Sign out when complete
7. Manually check in credentials in Platform (optional)
8. Access automatically expires after time window

**Important Notes:**
- Access is time-limited (2-4 hours)
- All actions are recorded and audited
- Unauthorized use will be flagged
- Abuse may result in access revocation

### 10.2: Create Approver Guide

Document for managers who approve requests:

**Reviewing SYSADMIN Access Requests:**
1. Check email notification or Platform for pending requests
2. Review justification carefully:
   - Is the task legitimate?
   - Does it require SYSADMIN privileges?
   - Is the duration reasonable?
3. Verify requester's role and need
4. Approve or deny with explanation
5. If approved, add guidance in approval comment
6. Monitor for completion

**Post-Approval Monitoring:**
- Review session recordings after access expires
- Verify only approved actions were performed
- Check Snowflake query history for validation
- Report any unauthorized actions to security team
